/**
 * @brief  Interface class which every optimizer should implement. Each optimizer must offer a next() and fit() function. However, if a certain optimizer does not support streaming (`next') or batch (`fit') processing it is okay to throw an exeception with an appropriate message. This class already offers a member to store the best solution (`solution') and its function value (`fval`) including getter functions. You can access the function to be maximized via `f` which is a shared pointer (and thus there is no need for explicit delete in the destructor). Please make sure to set `is_fitted` after the fit / next has been called. Please make sure that you use the `peek` and `update` function of the SubmodularFunction correctly. Always call `peek` if you want to know the function value if you would add a new element to the current solution and call `update` if you know which element to add to the current solution. See SubmodularFunction.h for more details.

     * Okay lets explain the reasoning behind this a bit more. 
     * 1):  Use SubmodularFunction as an object. This does not work because we are dealing with inheritance / virtual functions
     * 2):  Use a reference to SubmodularFunction. This works well with PyBind and has an easy interface, but breaks does not work well 
     *      together with the SubmodularFunctionWrapper if we want to allow users to pass a std::function directly.
     * 3):  Use SubmodularFunction* which would be a very "pure" and old-school approach. Should be do-able, but is not the modern c++ style
     * 4):  Use std::unique_ptr<SubmodularFunction>. This would IMHO be the best approach as it reflects our intend, that the SubmodularOptimizer owns the SubmodularFunction which it clones beforehand. This does not work well with PyBind since PyBind wants to own the memory. 
     * 5):  Use std::shared_ptr<SubmodularFunction> which is basically a modern version of 3) and works better with PyBind.
