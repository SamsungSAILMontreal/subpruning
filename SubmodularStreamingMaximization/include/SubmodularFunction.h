/**
 * @brief  A simple Wrapper class which takse a std::function and uses it to implement the SubmodularFunction interface. This is used as a convience class for the SubmodularOptimizer interface. This wrapper is meant for stateless functions so that the std::function __should not__ have / change / maintain an internal state which depends on the order of function calls. The main reason for this is, that the given std::function is likely to be moved into the member object (and not copied) which makes for very efficient code. However, some optimizers require multiple copies of the same function such as SieveStreaming(++) for multiple sub-optimizers. In this case, _all_ (sub-) optimizers reference the same object, which works fine if the function is stateless but probably breaks for stateful functions. If your submodular function requires some internal states which e.g. depend on the order of items added please consider to implement a `proper' SubmodularFunction.
